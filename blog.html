                    can infer that the object could not be created.

                <p class="px-10 text-xl w-[100%] lg:w-[75%]">
                    An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or
                    devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A <span
                        class="font-semibold text-amber-800">REST API</span> is an API that conforms to the
                    design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-4">
                <p class="px-10 py-3  text-xl font-semibold">How REST APIs work?</p>
                <p class="px-10 text-xl ">
                    REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating,
                    reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST
                    API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to
                    update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A
                    well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP
                    functionality. <br> <br>

                    The state of a resource at any particular instant, or timestamp, is known as the resource
                    representation. This information can be delivered to a client in virtually any format including
                    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular because
                    it’s readable by both humans and machines—and it is programming language-agnostic. <br> <br>

                    Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls because they include important
                    identifier information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers (URIs),
                    caching, cookies and more. Request headers and response headers, along with conventional HTTP status
                    codes, are used within well-designed REST APIs.
